## 3. Context and Problem Statement

### 3.1 Problem Description

ADR-001 established Azure AI Services as the enterprise AI platform for the SCTS GenAI Programme based on existing Azure hosting (TC-2), G-Cloud procurement (TC-3), and UK data residency (TC-4). Since that decision, comprehensive technology research has been completed for both AWS (ARC-001-AWRS-v1.1) and Azure (ARC-001-AZRS-v1.2) using MCP-verified authoritative documentation. This ADR uses the comparative evidence to confirm or revise the platform selection and define the role of AWS as a contingency option.

**Problem statement as a question**: Given detailed AWS and Azure research findings, should SCTS confirm Azure as the primary AI platform, switch to AWS, or adopt a multi-cloud strategy?

### 3.2 Why This Decision Is Needed

- ADR-001 was based on preliminary analysis; this ADR provides evidence-based confirmation using authoritative MCP-sourced research
- AWS research revealed specific advantages (human-in-the-loop, search cost) that warrant formal evaluation
- Azure research identified new capabilities (Content Understanding GA, confidential computing for AI Search) since ADR-001
- Stakeholders require documented comparison to satisfy spend control governance
- The decision affects GBP 200K+ over 3 years and locks procurement approach

- **Business context**: BR-001 (Operational Efficiency), BR-005 (Value for Money)
- **Technical context**: TC-2 (Azure Hosting Constraint), TC-6 (Azure AI Primary Platform)
- **Regulatory context**: UK GDPR, G-Cloud 14 procurement, NCSC Cloud Security Principles

### 3.3 Supporting Links

- **AWS Research**: [ARC-001-AWRS-v1.1](../research/ARC-001-AWRS-v1.1.md) — 20 AWS services across 7 categories, MCP-verified eu-west-2 availability
- **Azure Research**: [ARC-001-AZRS-v1.2](../research/ARC-001-AZRS-v1.2.md) — 4 Azure AI services + infrastructure, latest GA features
- **Prior ADR**: [ARC-001-ADR-001-v1.0](ARC-001-ADR-001-v1.0.md) — Foundational Azure platform decision
- **Requirements**: `ARC-001-REQ-v1.0.md` — 49 requirements across BR/FR/NFR/INT/DR
- **Risk Register**: `ARC-001-RISK-v1.0.md` — RISK-T-002 (Vendor Lock-in)
- **Principles**: `ARC-000-PRIN-v1.0.md` — 20 architecture principles

## 4. Decision Drivers (Forces)

### 4.1 Technical Drivers

- **Integration with Existing Azure Infrastructure (TC-2)**: SCTS has existing Azure hosting. Adding AWS creates cross-cloud networking, dual IAM, and operational complexity.
  - Requirements: INT-001 through INT-006
  - Principle 6: Interoperability and Integration
  - Weight: Critical — dual-cloud significantly increases integration burden

- **UK Data Residency (TC-4)**: Both platforms meet UK data residency. Azure UK South/West; AWS eu-west-2 (London).
  - Requirements: NFR-SEC-009 (Data Sovereignty)
  - Principle 15: Data Sovereignty and Residency
  - Weight: Neutral — both platforms pass

- **Speaker Diarisation (FR-004a)**: Azure provides native speaker diarisation and (historically) speaker recognition. AWS Transcribe supports diarisation but AWS lacks a speaker recognition equivalent.
  - Requirements: FR-004, FR-004a
  - Weight: Azure advantage for speech use cases

- **Human-in-the-Loop (Principle 2)**: AWS provides Amazon A2I as a native human review service with private workforce routing. Azure has no direct equivalent — requires custom development with Logic Apps/Power Automate.
  - Requirements: FR-003 (confidence thresholds), Principle 2
  - Weight: AWS advantage, but custom Azure solution is achievable

- **Search Cost Efficiency**: AWS OpenSearch Serverless at GBP 587/month vs Azure AI Search at GBP 470/month (S1). However, Azure AI Search now offers confidential computing, agentic retrieval, and knowledge agents (Aug-Dec 2025 GA releases).
  - Requirements: FR-010, FR-011
  - Weight: Comparable cost; Azure has richer recent features

### 4.2 Business Drivers

- **Total Cost of Ownership**: Azure 3-year TCO GBP 204,408 vs AWS 3-year TCO GBP 194,568. AWS is GBP 9,840 (5%) cheaper over 3 years, but this excludes cross-cloud integration costs if both are used.
  - Requirements: BR-005 (Value for Money)
  - Stakeholder: Finance Director (G-6)

- **Operational Simplicity**: Single-cloud strategy reduces operational overhead (one IAM system, one billing console, one security posture, one ops team skill set).
  - Stakeholder: ICT Operations (SD-5)

- **Skills and Training**: SCTS staff trained on Azure. Introducing AWS requires parallel training programme.
  - Weight: Strong Azure advantage

- **Vendor Concentration Risk**: Single-vendor dependency on Microsoft. AWS as contingency reduces concentration risk.
  - Risk: RISK-T-002 (Vendor Lock-in)
  - Weight: Moderate concern, mitigated by exit strategy and API abstraction

### 4.3 Regulatory & Compliance Drivers

- **G-Cloud Procurement**: Both available on G-Cloud 14 (RM1557.14). Azure as Microsoft Corporation; AWS as Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL.
  - TCoP Point 5: Cloud first — both satisfy

- **NCSC Cloud Security Principles**: Both meet 14/14 NCSC principles. Both provide compliance conformance packs (Azure Policy for UK OFFICIAL/NHS; AWS Config for NCSC CAF).
  - Both PASS

- **GDS Service Standard**: Both platforms support Points 4, 5, 9, 11. No differentiator.

- **Scottish Government AI Strategy**: Aligned with human-in-the-loop and transparency requirements on both platforms.

### 4.4 Alignment to Architecture Principles

| Principle | Azure | AWS | Impact |
|-----------|-------|-----|--------|
| 1. Justice-Centred Design | ✅ Supports | ✅ Supports | Both configurable for justice use cases |
| 2. Human-in-the-Loop | ✅ Custom build | ✅ Native A2I | AWS has native advantage; Azure achievable |
| 4. Scalability and Elasticity | ✅ Auto-scaling | ✅ Serverless-first | Both strong; AWS slightly more serverless-native |
| 5. Resilience and Continuity | ✅ UK South/West | ✅ eu-west-2, eu-west-1 DR | Both multi-AZ; Azure has UK-only DR pair |
| 6. Interoperability | ✅ Native (TC-2) | ⚠️ Cross-cloud needed | Azure wins on existing infrastructure |
| 11. Security by Design | ✅ ISO 27001, SOC 2 | ✅ ISO 27001, SOC 2 | Both equally certified |
| 15. Data Sovereignty | ✅ UK South/West | ✅ eu-west-2 | Both UK-resident; Azure DR stays within UK |
| 17. Observability | ✅ Azure Monitor | ✅ CloudWatch + X-Ray | Both comprehensive |
| 18. Cost Transparency | ✅ Cost Management | ✅ Cost Explorer | Both adequate |
| 20. Automation | ✅ Bicep/ARM | ✅ CDK/Terraform/CFN | Both full IaC support |

---

### Option 2: Switch to AWS as Primary Platform (Single-Cloud)

**Description**: Reverse ADR-001. Migrate all AI capabilities to AWS eu-west-2. Maintain Azure for existing non-AI hosting only (or migrate that too).

**Implementation approach**:
- All AI services in AWS eu-west-2 (London)
- Amazon A2I for native human-in-the-loop
- OpenSearch Serverless for cognitive search
- Cross-cloud networking if Azure hosting remains for non-AI workloads

**Wardley Evolution Stage**: Product (Off-the-shelf)

#### Good (Pros)
- ✅ **Native Human Review**: Amazon A2I provides out-of-box human-in-the-loop with private workforce
- ✅ **Serverless-First**: Lambda, OpenSearch Serverless, Step Functions — minimal idle cost
- ✅ **Lower Raw TCO**: GBP 194,568 over 3 years for AI services (5% cheaper)
- ✅ **Bedrock Guardrails**: 7 content filter types including automated reasoning checks
- ✅ **3 Well-Architected AI Lenses**: Responsible AI, ML, and Generative AI lenses (re:Invent 2025)

#### Bad (Cons)
- ❌ **Cross-Cloud Complexity**: If Azure hosting remains, requires VPN/peering, dual IAM, dual monitoring
- ❌ **Staff Retraining**: Entire SCTS team needs AWS training programme (estimated GBP 30,000)
- ❌ **Migration Cost**: Migrating from existing Azure hosting adds GBP 40,000-80,000
- ❌ **Speaker Recognition Gap**: No AWS equivalent for speaker identification (FR-004a)
- ❌ **DR Outside UK**: eu-west-2 DR option is eu-west-1 (Ireland) — data leaves UK jurisdiction
- ❌ **Contradicts TC-2**: Existing Azure hosting constraint requires cross-cloud integration
- ❌ **Procurement Disruption**: New G-Cloud call-off required; delays programme 2-3 months

#### Cost Analysis
| Cost Item | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| AWS AI Services | £72,600 | £63,888 | £58,080 | With Savings Plans |

| 9. Create secure service | ✅ Positive | NCSC-assured, Security Hub, GuardDuty |
| 11. Plan for offline | ⚠️ Concern | DR to eu-west-1 (Ireland) — outside UK |

---

### Option 3: Multi-Cloud Strategy (Azure Primary + AWS for Selected Services)

**Description**: Use Azure for most AI services (document intelligence, speech, translation) per ADR-001, but adopt AWS for specific capabilities where it excels: Amazon A2I for human review and OpenSearch Serverless for cognitive search.

**Implementation approach**:
- Azure AI Document Intelligence, Speech, Translator in Azure UK South
- Amazon A2I + Step Functions for human-in-the-loop pipeline in eu-west-2
- Amazon OpenSearch Serverless for cognitive search in eu-west-2
- Cross-cloud API integration via API Management

**Wardley Evolution Stage**: Product (Off-the-shelf) — both platforms mature

#### Good (Pros)
- ✅ **Best-of-Breed**: Azure for document/speech/translation; AWS for human review and search
- ✅ **Reduced Vendor Concentration**: Spread across two hyperscalers
- ✅ **Native A2I**: Avoids building custom human review on Azure
- ✅ **Cost Optimisation**: Search costs potentially lower on OpenSearch Serverless

#### Bad (Cons)
- ❌ **Dual Cloud Operations**: Two IAM systems, two billing consoles, two security postures, two monitoring stacks
- ❌ **Cross-Cloud Latency**: API calls between Azure UK South and AWS eu-west-2 add 2-5ms latency
- ❌ **Data Transfer Costs**: Court documents crossing cloud boundaries incur egress charges
- ❌ **Compliance Complexity**: Two separate NCSC attestations, two G-Cloud call-offs, dual audit surface
- ❌ **Staff Skills**: Team must be proficient in both Azure and AWS
- ❌ **Data Residency Risk**: Data flowing between two cloud providers increases surface area for data governance
- ❌ **Increased Integration Risk**: Cross-cloud failures harder to diagnose and resolve

#### Cost Analysis
| Cost Item | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Azure AI Services (Doc/Speech/Translation) | £46,440 | £44,988 | £43,596 | Azure core AI only |
| AWS Services (A2I + OpenSearch + Step Functions) | £10,044 | £9,636 | £9,240 | Human review + search |
| Cross-Cloud Networking | £15,000 | £8,000 | £8,000 | VPN, API gateways, data transfer |
| Dual Cloud Operations | £12,000 | £12,000 | £12,000 | Additional monitoring, security |
| Staff Training (AWS) | £15,000 | £3,000 | £2,000 | Partial AWS training |
| **Total** | **£98,484** | **£77,624** | **£74,836** | |
| **3-Year TCO** | | | **£250,944** | Multi-cloud premium |

#### GDS Service Standard Impact
| Point | Impact | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 4. Open standards | ✅ Positive | REST APIs on both platforms |
| 5. Everyone can use | ✅ Positive | Same AI capabilities available |
| 9. Create secure service | ⚠️ Increased Complexity | Dual security posture; larger audit surface |
| 11. Plan for offline | ⚠️ More Failure Modes | Cross-cloud dependency creates new failure paths |

---

### Option 4: Do Nothing (Defer Decision)

**Description**: Do not make a platform comparison decision. Continue with ADR-001 (Azure only) without formally evaluating AWS findings. Discard AWS research.

#### Good (Pros)
- ✅ **No immediate action**: No governance overhead
- ✅ **No complexity**: Continue single-cloud path

#### Bad (Cons)
- ❌ **Wasted Research**: GBP value of AWS research effort not captured as formal decision record
- ❌ **Governance Gap**: Spend control reviewers may question why alternative was not formally evaluated
- ❌ **No Contingency Plan**: If Azure has a major incident, no documented fallback
- ❌ **Vendor Lock-in Unaddressed**: RISK-T-002 remains unmitigated without formal contingency

---

## 6. Decision Outcome

### 6.1 Chosen Option

**"Option 1: Confirm Azure as Primary Platform (Single-Cloud)"** — with AWS documented as the formal contingency platform.

### 6.2 Y-Statement (Structured Justification)

> **In the context of** selecting the cloud platform for AI document intelligence, speech, translation, and search capabilities for Scottish courts,
> **facing** the need to balance technical capability, cost, operational simplicity, UK data residency, and vendor risk,
> **we decided for** confirming Azure as the primary platform with AWS as the documented contingency,
> **to achieve** lowest total cost of ownership (GBP 223,408), native integration with existing infrastructure (TC-2), operational simplicity, and UK-only disaster recovery,
> **accepting** vendor concentration on Microsoft and the need to build a custom human-in-the-loop solution rather than using AWS's native A2I service.

### 6.3 Justification (Why This Option?)

**Key reasons**:

1. **Lowest Realistic TCO**: While AWS raw AI service costs are 5% cheaper (GBP 194,568 vs GBP 204,408), the true comparison must account for cross-cloud integration, migration, and retraining costs. Azure single-cloud TCO is GBP 223,408; switching to AWS costs GBP 351,568 (57% more); multi-cloud costs GBP 250,944 (12% more). The GBP 9,840 AWS saving is consumed many times over by operational complexity.

2. **Existing Infrastructure Integration (TC-2)**: SCTS already operates on Azure. Staying single-cloud eliminates cross-cloud networking costs (GBP 15,000-40,000/year), dual monitoring, and integration complexity. This directly supports Principle 6 (Interoperability).

3. **UK-Only DR Pair**: Azure UK South → UK West provides disaster recovery entirely within UK jurisdiction. AWS eu-west-2 → eu-west-1 (Ireland) would place DR data outside the UK, creating data sovereignty complications for court records.

4. **Staff Readiness**: Zero retraining cost for Azure. AWS switch or multi-cloud would require GBP 15,000-30,000 in training plus productivity loss during ramp-up.

5. **Azure Feature Evolution**: Since ADR-001, Azure has released Content Understanding GA, AI Search confidential computing, AI Search agentic retrieval with knowledge agents, fast transcription GA, and real-time diarisation containers — strengthening the Azure proposition.

6. **Human Review Gap is Manageable**: AWS A2I is a genuine advantage, but building a confidence-based routing workflow on Azure using Logic Apps + Functions is a 4-6 week effort costing approximately GBP 15,000 — far less than the GBP 128,000 premium of switching to AWS.

7. **Simplified Governance**: Single G-Cloud call-off, single security posture, single NCSC attestation, single audit surface. Reduces compliance burden for a public sector organisation.

**Stakeholder consensus**:
- Technical Architect: Recommends Azure for integration simplicity; acknowledges A2I advantage but considers custom build acceptable
- Finance Director: Azure is lowest realistic TCO when operational costs included
- DPO: Prefers UK-only DR pair (Azure UK South/West); concerned about AWS eu-west-1 DR
- Security Manager: Single security posture preferred; dual-cloud doubles audit surface
- Procurement: Single G-Cloud call-off simpler and faster

**Risk appetite**: SCTS has conservative risk appetite appropriate to justice sector. Single-cloud with documented contingency balances operational simplicity against vendor concentration risk.

## 7. Consequences

### 7.1 Positive Consequences

- ✅ **Operational Simplicity**: Single cloud platform, single ops team, single skill set
- ✅ **Lowest Realistic TCO**: GBP 223,408 over 3 years (vs GBP 250,944 multi-cloud or GBP 351,568 AWS switch)
- ✅ **UK-Only Data Sovereignty**: All data including DR stays within UK jurisdiction
- ✅ **Zero Retraining**: Staff continue using familiar Azure platform
- ✅ **Documented Contingency**: AWS research captured for formal fallback if Azure fails
- ✅ **Simplified Governance**: Single vendor, single G-Cloud call-off, single compliance audit

**Measurable outcomes**:
- Platform cost variance: < 10% from GBP 223,408 projection over 3 years
- Cross-cloud integration incidents: 0 (single-cloud eliminates this category)
- Time to deploy AI services: 6-9 months (no platform migration delay)
- Staff retraining cost: GBP 0

### 7.2 Negative Consequences (Accepted Trade-offs)

- ❌ **Vendor Concentration**: 100% Microsoft dependency for hosting and AI
- ❌ **No Native Human Review**: Must build custom confidence-based routing (GBP 15,000, 4-6 weeks)
- ❌ **Marginal Raw Cost Premium**: 5% more than AWS for raw AI service costs
- ❌ **AWS A2I Unused**: Genuine native capability not leveraged

**Mitigation strategies**:
- **Vendor concentration**: Abstract all AI services behind internal API layer; maintain ARC-001-AWRS-v1.1 as documented contingency with specific migration plan; schedule annual vendor review
- **Custom human review**: Design modular review pipeline using Azure Functions + Logic Apps; reusable across all AI capabilities; document as reusable component
- **Raw cost premium**: Negotiate commitment tier pricing at Year 2; monitor Azure vs AWS pricing quarterly; 5% premium (GBP 3,280/year) is acceptable given operational savings

### 7.3 Neutral Consequences (Changes Needed)

- 🔄 **Custom Human Review Development**: 4-6 week development sprint to build confidence-based routing pipeline
- 🔄 **AWS Contingency Documentation**: Maintain ARC-001-AWRS-v1.1 with annual refresh; document migration trigger criteria and timeline
- 🔄 **Vendor Review Process**: Establish annual Azure vs AWS pricing and capability review

### 7.4 Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|--------|------------|-------|
| Microsoft major service disruption (>72 hours) | Low | Very High | Documented AWS contingency (ARC-001-AWRS-v1.1); manual fallback procedures; 4-8 week migration timeline | AI Technical Architect |
| Azure pricing increases (>20%) | Low | Medium | Annual pricing review; commitment tier locks; documented AWS alternative TCO | Finance Lead |
| Azure AI feature stagnation | Low | Medium | Annual capability review; AWS research refresh; modular API abstraction enables switch | AI Technical Architect |

## 10. Implementation Plan

### 10.1 Dependencies

**Prerequisite decisions**:
- ADR-001: Adopt Azure AI Services — this ADR confirms and strengthens ADR-001

**Infrastructure dependencies**:
- Azure subscription configured for UK South/West (already in place)
- No AWS infrastructure required for primary platform

**Team dependencies**:
- Custom human review development team (4-6 weeks effort)

### 10.2 Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Activities | Duration | Owner |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Phase 1: ADR Approval** | Stakeholder review, Enterprise Architecture Board approval | 2 weeks | Enterprise Architect |
| **Phase 2: Human Review Build** | Custom confidence-based routing pipeline on Azure | 6 weeks | Development Team |
| **Phase 3: API Abstraction** | Implement provider-agnostic API layer over Azure AI services | 4 weeks | Development Team |
| **Phase 4: Contingency Documentation** | Document AWS migration trigger criteria, timeline, and procedure | 2 weeks | AI Technical Architect |
| **Phase 5: Annual Review Setup** | Establish Azure vs AWS pricing/capability review calendar | 1 week | Finance Lead |

### 10.3 Rollback Plan

**Rollback trigger**: Azure major service failure > 72 hours; Azure pricing increase > 30%; Azure service discontinuation announcement

**Rollback procedure**:
1. Activate manual fallback procedures for court operations
2. Retrieve ARC-001-AWRS-v1.1 as migration target
3. Initiate G-Cloud call-off for AWS (2-4 weeks)
4. Execute phased migration: Search → Translation → Speech → Document Intelligence (8-12 weeks)
5. Decommission Azure AI resources after validation

**Rollback owner**: Chief Digital Information Officer

## 11. Review and Updates

### 11.1 Review Schedule

**Initial review**: 2026-08-03 (6 months after approval)

**Periodic review**: Annual (February)

**Review criteria**:
- Has Azure vs AWS pricing differential changed significantly (>15%)?
- Has Azure released native human-in-the-loop capability?
- Has AWS addressed speaker recognition gap?
- Has either platform had significant security incidents?
- Is the custom human review pipeline performing adequately?
- Should AWS contingency research be refreshed?

### 11.2 Trigger Events for Review

- [x] Azure AI service pricing restructure (>15% change)
- [x] Major Azure security incident affecting UK Government customers
- [x] AWS releases UK-only DR pair (UK region pair)
- [x] SCTS considers migrating non-AI workloads away from Azure
- [x] Azure announces service discontinuation for any core AI service
- [x] AWS A2I equivalent released on Azure (native human review)
- [x] Regulatory changes requiring multi-cloud (unlikely but possible)
